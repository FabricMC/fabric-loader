Chain-loader
===========

This is the loader of Chain, a fork of fabric with the 2 goals of introducing python to the modding scene and allowing for bedrock to join in on the fun.
You should know that this is in its **I litterally-just-set-this-up** stages and as of now, I haven't made any changes to this
